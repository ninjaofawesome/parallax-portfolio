                <p class="intro splash centered">
                  The best work that I do sometimes never sees the light of my Github day.  Yet each project that I am involved in is a valuable learning lesson and has shaped me into a better developer.
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                  I love to write code, I love to learn,  and I love to collaborate.  I was part of the inaugural Full Stack Web Development Fellowship at the Flatiron School, and from day one I have only done the things that I love.
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                  Each project that I work on gives me a chance to try new techniques, libraries and tools that I'm interested in.  I enjoy a MEAN stack, asynchronous JavaScript, Angular, Ember, Sass, Bourbon, Neat and Bitters.  Each project that I work on gives me a new opportunity to try a new approach, and revisiting previous ones oftentimes gives me the satisfaction of refactoring born of experience.
                  </p>
                  <p class="intro">Although some of my most technically challenging work has been proprietary, I oftentimes find myself working on projects pro-bono that interest me, for people who are interesting to me.  Check out some of my work below.
